Haque Garments

📌 Project Purpose

I have created a website named Haque Garments, which works as a complete online garments store.
In this website, the manager can easily add, update, and manage products. Each product includes images, price, and detailed descriptions.

Buyers can browse different types of garments available on the site. The website has a simple and user-friendly interface, making shopping easy for everyone. Customers can select their desired products and place orders smoothly. The system ensures a secure and reliable buying process.

Overall, this website helps make the garments business more digital, organized, and efficient.
